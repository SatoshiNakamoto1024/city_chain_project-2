# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- Handle multiple transactions.
- DApps should interact with municipal and main chains.
- Implement Verifiable Credentials for user authentication and integrity.
- Use NTRU encryption for securing data transactions.
- Use NTRU signatures for verifying transaction authenticity.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements: Ensure that the system can handle a high volume of transactions with low latency.
- Security requirements: Implement robust encryption and signature algorithms to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
- Scalability: The system should be able to scale to handle an increasing number of transactions and participants.
- Reliability: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance in the system to minimize downtime and data loss.
- Compliance: Adhere to relevant legal and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy.
- Interoperability: Ensure compatibility between Rust and Python implementations, particularly in the context of NTRU encryption and signature verification.
- Usability: Provide user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the DApps and mobile applications.
- Maintainability: Ensure the system is easy to maintain and update, with clear documentation and modular design.
