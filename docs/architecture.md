# Architecture

## High-Level Architecture
The system consists of multiple chains including municipal chains, continental chains, and a global main chain, each responsible for handling different levels of transactions and data. The DApps and mobile app provide user interfaces to interact with the system.

## Detailed Architecture
- **Main Chain**: The primary blockchain that aggregates data from continental chains.
- **Continental Chain**: Intermediate blockchains that gather data from municipal chains and forward to the main chain.
- **Municipal Chain**: Local blockchains handling transactions within municipalities.
- **DApps**: Decentralized applications that provide the user interface for transactions and interactions.
- **Mobile App**: Mobile version of DApps for on-the-go access.

### Security Integration
- **NTRU Encryption and Signatures**: Used for securing transactions and verifying signatures across the system. This involves the use of lattice-based cryptography to ensure robust security against quantum computing threats.
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Implemented to ensure the authenticity and integrity of users' credentials within the system. This ensures that users' identities and actions are verifiable and trustworthy, enhancing the overall security of the system.
