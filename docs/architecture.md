# Architecture

## High-Level Architecture
The system consists of multiple chains including municipal chains, continental chains, and a global main chain, each responsible for handling different levels of transactions and data. The DApps and mobile app provide user interfaces to interact with the system.

## Detailed Architecture
- **Global Main Chain**: The primary blockchain that aggregates data from continental chains.
- **Continental Chain**: Intermediate blockchains that gather data from municipal chains and forward it to the global main chain.
- **Municipal Chain**: Local blockchains handling transactions within municipalities.
- **DApps**: Decentralized applications that provide the user interface for transactions and interactions.
- **Mobile App**: Mobile version of DApps for on-the-go access.

## Consensus Algorithms
The system employs various consensus algorithms to ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain network.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
#### Struct Definition
```rust
struct DPoS {
    municipalities: Vec<String>,
    approved_representative: Option<String>,
}

impl DPoS {
    fn new(municipalities: Vec<String>) -> Self {
        Self {
            municipalities,
            approved_representative: None,
        }
    }

    fn elect_representative(&mut self) -> String {
        let representative = self.municipalities.choose(&mut rand::thread_rng()).unwrap().clone();
        self.approved_representative = Some(representative.clone());
        representative
    }

    fn approve_transaction(&self, transaction: &mut Transaction) -> Result<&str, &str> {
        if let Some(representative) = &self.approved_representative {
            transaction.signature = format!("approved_by_{}", representative);
            Ok("Transaction approved")
        } else {
            Err("No representative elected")
        }
    }
}
